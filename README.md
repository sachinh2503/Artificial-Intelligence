# Artificial-Intelligence
Helping the LA Dept of Transportation (LADOT) to develop a pilot scooter program for LA. There are a limited number of police officers available to monitor and address issues that may arise from scooters, ranging from traffic and safety violations to accidents with cars, bikes, other scooters and pedestrians. The scooter companies have given LADOT access to scooter routes over the course of one day. In order to maximize the scooter activity monitored by the officers, you will take as input the route information,the monitored city area dimensions, and the number of officers available to then generate the best placement of the officers. The officers can only be in one place for one day, and there can only be one officer on each street. When an officer and scooter are at the same location at the same time, the officer is able to address a safety issue, and one “Activity point” is gained.

This is a variant of standard N-Queens problems and can be said as a weighted N-Queens problem.
